# hello-world
This repository is for learning the github flow
I have spent most of my life pursuing art and accounting. Web development is not something that I thought I could ever commit to full time due to my many interests, but now I am excited and curious about this new world that I have become a part of. In the past I would avoid anything challenging or difficult. However, I have grown to become someone that sees a challenge as a chance for growth and development.  I am very excited for the future that awaits meðŸ¤—
